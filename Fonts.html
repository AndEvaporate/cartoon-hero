Gus is gonna make his move. I don't know when, I don't know where or how. All I know is it's gonna happen. Powerless to stop him. 

<p>I have been waiting. I've been waiting all day. <span>Waiting for Gus</span> to send one of his men to kill me. And it's you. Who do you know, who's okay with using children, Jesse? Who do you know... who's allowed children to be murdered... hmm? Gus! He has, he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn. And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent and boy he's got that now. He's got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.</p>

<h2>No! You don't even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please. Listen to yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he's wanted.</h2>
